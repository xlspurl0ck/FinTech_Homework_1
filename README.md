The Apple Card was officially announced at Apple's Special Event on March 25, 2019. 
It is a joint effort between Apple and Goldman Sachs with the primary goal of improving financial health while also encouraging virtual banking
through Apple's Apple Pay service.
Apple Pay generates revenew by charging a small service fee to the issuing bank per transaction, with the Apple Card Goldman Sachs assumes the
role of the issuing bank for the card.

## Business Activity

With the Apple Card, Apple is attempting to reinvent the credit card by eliminating traditional factors such as fees and by implementing
practices like unlimited daily cash.
The intended customer is anybody that uses Apple Pay. As of September 2019 it’s been reported that there are about 441 million Apple Pay users
with only 48% of iPhone users enabling the service. To date approximately 3.1 million Americans own an Apple Card.
While the Apple Card may have high interest rates for a credit card, the rates are relatively low when compared to other cash back credit
cards offered by it’s competition at Chase, American Express, and even Mastercard.
An applicant with an excellent credit rating can receive interest rates as 10.99% wheras the same applicant would only be able to receive an
interest rate as low as 13.99% with for American Express' Blue Cash Everyday card which offers similar incentives to customers.

In addition to being able to offer relatively low interest rates and unlimited daily cash back, the Apple Card also utilizes machine learning
to educate consumers about their spending habits. It will change colors based on usage within the wallet app on the iPhone and graphs are made
available on the app as well. Through the use of these graphs, ideally, users will be able to identify excessive purchases they make regularly
like fast food and be able to remove them from their normal spending habits to reduce spending.

## Landscape

The Apple Card would fall under the domain of Personal Finance as at the end of the day it is just a credit card, albeit one that utilizes
technology quite well.
Online banking is undoubtedly the biggest innovation affecting personal finance today. New cards can be applied for/ordered, bills can be paid,
and statements can be viewed all without having to leave the couch. However, an honorable mention must be made for the EMV Card, or the chip as most refer to it.
EMV cards have been around since 1994 but were not widely adopted until 2015 due to rising concern of credit card fraud. Due to the way data was stored
on old cards, banking information was more suseptible to being stolen with the help of some hardware but with the chip all transactions are encoded individually,
making it harder for people to recover and then steal transaction information.

The Apple Card's biggest competition would be American Express's Blue Cash Everyday card, JP Morgan Chase's Freedom Unlimited Card, and Citi Bank's
Citi Double Cash card. The reason those cards would be considered competition as opposed to the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the American Express Gold Card
is because none of them have an annual fee and all of them are cash back cards just like the Apple Card.

## Results

Currently the Apple Card is only available in the United States. It is less than a year old and roughly 3.1 million Americans have the card in their wallets, that
is 2.2% of the U.S. adult population. In November of 2019, Goldman Sachs reported that within 6 weeks of the Apple Card's release they had issued $10 billion
in credit to card holders, with the new card holders having run $736 million in loan balances within that time period.

Some of the top key performance indicators used to measure the success of a credit card are:
* Customer Acquisition Cost
* Churn
* Card Portfolio Growth Rate
* Cash Cost of Service Per Card
* Average Revenue Per Card
* Average Margin Per Card
* Net Promoter Index
* Generated Income for the Credit Card Business/Issuing Bank
* Protection From Defaults
* Charge-offs

Unfortunately since Apple has not released any of this metric data the true success of the Apple Card can only be speculated on based off of the information
that Goldman Sach's has made available. Considering the age and small operating radius of the Apple Card, most would consider it to be doing well but it is not
as successful as it's competition yet.

## Recommendations

If I were to advise Apple on what to do with the Apple Card to improve upon it's early success, the biggest thing I would reccomend would be expansion.
Most credit cards are available worldwide wheras the Apple Card is only available in the United States and as a result of that limitation there are only
3.1 million card holders, meanwhile Apple Pay is available across the globe and has about 441 million users. Since Apple Pay and Apple Card are supposed to 
compliment each other, it is safe to say that there is an untapped global market for the Apple Card.
Additionally, the Apple Card does not have welcoming bonuses for new card applicants. Offers like "Receive $500 credit after spending $2000 within first 3 months"
are available with Chase & American Express' cash back cards and would surely entice a few more people into finally signing up for the card.

A global expansion would require the use of a more advanced payment network, especially since the Apple Card is paperless. Luckily since Goldman Sach's is the issuing
bank for the Apple Card, payments for the card are done using Mastercard's payment network which is actually capable of taking care of global and local customers.
Expansion has to be on the horizon and the Apple Card already has all the tools to do so.
